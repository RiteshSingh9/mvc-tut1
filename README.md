1. **Webroot** is only accessible directory for visitor
2. **Router.php, dispatcher.php, request.php, .htaccess** are part of the routing system
3. **Config** : all the configuration needed by our website. We will retrieve then the db.php file which is the single access point to our database (singleton class).
